# JMetrics

Static Code Metrics tool

========

JMetrics is a standalone Java application that provides static code metrics of Java projects and presents them in the terminal

========

### Usage
* Open a terminal app
* Navigate to the folder that contains the JMetrics.jar file
* Type ``` java JMetrics.jar -jar <path-to-the-project-folder> ```
* Output shall be presented in the terminal.

### Note

This is a work in progress project with all that comes with it.

The version that works and provides accurate results is the master (effectively  branch 0.3)

If you desire to play with current experiments and implementations feel free to fork the 0.2 branch but do not expect it to work.
